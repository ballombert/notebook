Title: Unraveling the Controversy: A Critical Examination of Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD)

Introduction: Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) has garnered attention as a concept claiming to explain a sudden onset of gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults. However, this article aims to critically analyze the validity and implications of ROGD. By examining the evidence, methodology, and the concerns raised by experts in the field, we seek to shed light on the controversial nature of this concept.

1.  The Lack of Scientific Rigor:

-   Discuss the methodology and limitations of the original study that introduced ROGD.
-   Highlight the absence of rigorous scientific research supporting the concept.
-   Address concerns regarding potential bias, sampling issues, and lack of control groups in ROGD studies.

2.  Alternative Explanations:

-   Present alternative explanations for the observed phenomenon, such as increased societal acceptance of diverse gender identities.
-   Explore the role of social influence and the impact of peer groups in shaping individual gender identities.
-   Consider the possibility that ROGD may be a misinterpretation of normal exploration and questioning of gender identity during adolescence.

3.  Pathologizing Transgender Identities:

-   Examine the potential harm caused by pathologizing transgender individuals through the ROGD framework.
-   Discuss the implications of invalidating transgender identities and experiences.
-   Highlight the importance of affirming transgender individuals and providing appropriate healthcare support.

4.  Ethical Concerns and Stigma:

-   Address the potential consequences of the ROGD concept on access to gender-affirming healthcare for transgender individuals.
-   Discuss the perpetuation of stigma and discrimination against transgender individuals through the ROGD discourse.
-   Examine the ethical implications of relying on a controversial concept to guide clinical decisions and policies.

5.  Expert Rejection and Professional Consensus:

-   Highlight the lack of recognition and acceptance of ROGD by major professional organizations and experts in the field.
-   Discuss the stance of organizations such as the APA and WPATH on transgender healthcare and their concerns about the ROGD concept.
-   Emphasize the importance of relying on evidence-based guidelines and consensus when it comes to providing healthcare for transgender individuals.

Conclusion: As we critically examine the concept of ROGD, it becomes clear that it lacks solid scientific foundation and raises ethical concerns. The focus should be on providing support and affirmation to transgender individuals rather than pathologizing their experiences. By fostering understanding, empathy, and evidence-based practices, we can create an inclusive society that respects and supports individuals of all gender identities.


ROGD signifie Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria. Il s’agit d’un terme controversé et relativement nouveau utilisé pour décrire un phénomène où des individus, généralement des adolescents ou de jeunes adultes, éprouvent un sentiment soudain et intense de dysphorie de genre. Ces personnes peuvent n’avoir eu aucune indication antérieure de dysphorie de genre ou d’identité transgenre pendant l’enfance.
