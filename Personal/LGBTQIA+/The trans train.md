Through on "The Trans Train" a Swedish documentary:  
Why people focus on an issue that has so little to do with transition ? Yes, there is a need for psychological follow-up for people seeking transition. But just because the regret rate is 1% on medical transitions doesn't mean you have to stop everything. I see a growing anti-trans movement right now feeding on this kind of information to keep us from being ourselves. It's also strange to see that the media focuses on problematic transitions.
