Although emergence of gender dysphoria at puberty is long established, a distinct pathway of rapid onset gender dysphoria was recently hypothesized based on parental data. Using adolescent clinical data, we tested a series of associations that would be consistent with this pathway, however, our results did not support the rapid onset gender dysphoria hypothesis.

Puberty has long been understood as one period when gender dysphoria often first emerges.

 Although most transgender (trans) older adolescents and adults report needing gender-affirming medical care (hormones and/or surgeries), and also report having been aware of their gender at young ages,

[2](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib2)

 only a small proportion receive gender-affirming care as adolescents. Use of hormonal suppression with a gonadotropic-releasing hormone agonist, and hormones such as estrogen and testosterone therapies in trans and gender-diverse adolescents is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the Endocrine Society, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.

In 2018, a phenomenon of rapid onset gender dysphoria was hypothesized as a distinct pathway involving social contagion among youth vulnerable due to mental or neurodevelopmental disorders,

 raising public concerns regarding potential for later regret following gender-affirming medical care. This discussion has occurred primarily in the context of data from a single online parental survey.

 its hypotheses have not yet been tested on data from youth themselves. Specifically, rapid onset gender dysphoria is hypothesized as a phenomenon in youth with gender dysphoria emerging at or after puberty, socially influenced through peer contagion, and with contributing factors including poor mental health, neurodevelopmental disabilities, parent-child conflict, and maladaptive coping strategies.

If the rapid onset gender dysphoria hypothesis indeed characterizes a distinct clinical phenomenon, and these youth access referrals for hormone suppression or gender-affirming hormones, then we would expect to see differentiation within clinical samples between those with more-recent (ie, rapid-onset) vs more-remote knowledge regarding their gender. Based on the published hypothesis,

[10](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib10)

 we would expect more recent gender knowledge to be associated with self-reported mental health measures, mental health and neurodevelopmental disability diagnoses, behaviors consistent with maladaptive coping (eg, self-harm), support from online and/or transgender friends but not parents, and lesser gender dysphoria. We aim to test these hypotheses.

## Methods

Baseline data (2017-2019) from the Trans Youth CAN! Cohort included pubertal/postpubertal adolescents age <16 years attending a first referral visit for hormone suppression or gender-affirming hormones at 10 Canadian medical clinics that provide specialized gender-affirming care to adolescents through a range of different care models. Ethics approval was received from all study sites. Years gender was known was missing for 1 participant (excluded), for a final sample of n = 173. Methods and measures are described in detail elsewhere.

[18](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib18)

Self-reported measures were obtained from baseline interviewer-administered adolescent surveys,

[19](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib19)

 and diagnoses from baseline clinical records.

[20](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib20)

 Recent gender knowledge was coded by subtracting age in years from age adolescents self-reported they “realized your gender was different from what other people called you.” As ages were whole numbers, a difference of 1 could indicate <1 year to just under 2 years. Values ≤1 were coded as recent gender knowledge, with an alternate definition (values ≤2) for sensitivity analysis. Mental health symptoms were assessed with the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale,

[21](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib21)

 the Modified Depression Scale,

[22](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib22)

 and the Kessler-6 scale for psychological distress.

[23](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib23)

 Mental health diagnoses extracted from chart included anxiety, depression, personality disorder, eating disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses included autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Gender dysphoria symptoms were assessed using the Trans Youth CAN! Gender Distress Scale.

[24](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib24)

 Self-reported mental health behaviors included self-harm, substance use, and suicidal behavior. Three measures captured social connections to online and trans communities: having gender-supportive online friends was coded if adolescents reported online friends who knew their gender and were “very supportive,” and having online or trans friends as general sources of support was indicated in checklist items. Parental support was coded if youth indicated all biological/step/foster parents were “very supportive” of their gender identity or expression.

Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS v 9.4.1 (SAS Institute, Inc), weighted to account for clinics' different recruitment periods due to staggered start dates, to improve generalizability.

[18](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib18)

 For analyses of associations between recency of gender knowledge and hypothesized correlates, a series of multiple regressions was conducted, with recency as the independent variable of interest, controlling for age and sex assigned at birth. Linear regressions were used for continuous dependent variables (eg, psychometric scales). For dichotomous dependent variables, modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimation was used.

[25](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib25)

 As “rapid-onset” has not been precisely defined, we conducted a sensitivity analysis repeating these analyses using the alternate (value ≤2) definition of recent gender knowledge.

## Results

Recency of gender knowledge is presented in the [Figure](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#gr1), results of hypothesized associations (recency value ≤ 1) in [Table I](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#tbl1), and variable means and frequencies in [Table II](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#tblE2) (available at [www.jpeds.com](https://www.jpeds.com/)). Controlling for age and sex assigned at birth, recent gender knowledge was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms, psychological distress, past diagnoses with mental health issues or neurodevelopmental disorders, gender dysphoria symptoms, self-harm, past-year suicide attempt, having gender-supportive online friends, general support from online friends or transgender friends, or gender support from parents. Recent gender knowledge was associated with lower scores on anxiety severity/impairment (b = −3.272; 95% CI −5.172, −1.373), and lower prevalence of marijuana use (prevalence ratio = 0.11; 95% CI 0.02, 0.82), counter to hypothesized directions of effect. For sensitivity analysis using the alternate (value ≤2) definition of recent gender knowledge, we found all results substantively the same in statistical significance and direction of effect, except past-year marijuana use, which now only approached statistical significance (_P_ = .0677).

FigureRecency of gender knowledge among adolescents age <16 years referred to Canadian clinics for hormone suppression or gender-affirming hormones (n = 173). Age at which knew gender was different was subtracted from current age in years; thus, “2 years” could range from more than 1 year to less than 3 years. Lighter gray represents recent gender knowledge in this analysis, with a sensitivity analysis also including the patterned bar.

## Discussion

We did not find support within a clinical population for a new etiologic phenomenon of rapid onset gender dysphoria during adolescence. Among adolescents under age 16 years seen in specialized gender clinics, associations between more recent gender knowledge and factors hypothesized to be involved in rapid onset gender dysphoria were either not statistically significant, or were in the opposite direction to what would be hypothesized. This putative phenomenon was posited based on survey data from a convenience sample of parents recruited from websites,

[10](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext#bib10)

 and may represent the perceptions or experiences of those parents, rather than of adolescents, particularly those who may enter into clinical care. Similar analyses should be replicated using additional clinical and community data sources. Our finding of lower anxiety severity/impairment scores in adolescents with more recent gender knowledge suggests the potential for longstanding experiences of gender dysphoria (or their social complications) playing a role in development of anxiety, which could also be explored in future research.
