**User Story**

As a customer care member, I want to know the last sanity status of platform return by manual or automated sanity check process, so that I can analyze if issues with the EV Charger are due to a defects on the residential platform.

  

**Scenario**

CCC member is assisting end-user with charger issues and wants to verify that the Resi back end is not the issue. They use the CCC sanity check API which replies with the result of the last sanity check (Ok or Fail). They can also use an API to see the last Sanity Check by category or test.

**User Story 

As a platform manager, I want to assure platform security access on API by creating and managing access rôle that can be given to a network access key, so that I can assure that security access is set on a minimal access strategy given by the cybersecurity governance 


**Scenario**

A platform manager need to set up a restricted access role for one or many network (ex: access for data analytics). They can modify the configuration to add specific access of the API to a new role. So They can create new API key with the specific role to limit the access to minimal and assure a security of the platforms.
